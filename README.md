## Description

KeysHit is a challenging, addictvie, typing and memory game. Basically, it helps user exercise concentration and memory, and practice keyboard typing. KeysHit is a learning game and hence address the Hackathon theme No. 4 (i.e. HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented.)

I myself find it all addictive!
